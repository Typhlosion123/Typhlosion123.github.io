              <p>Embarking on my projects to research STEM education and diversity, building a deep learning model to
                assess DNA bendability using Kmer frequencies, and constructing an FTC robot has been an incredibly
                important and exhilarating journey. Through my research on STEM education, I aim to uncover ways to make
                science and technology accessible to a diverse range of students, fostering inclusivity and innovation
                in the field. Building the deep learning model to explore DNA bendability allows me to delve into the
                cutting-edge realm of computational biology, unraveling the mysteries of genetic structures. And the
                thrill of assembling an FTC robot, with its potential to solve real-world challenges, has ignited my
                passion for engineering and problem-solving. These projects have not only expanded my knowledge and
                skills but have also reaffirmed the coolness and immense impact that STEM endeavors can have on the
                world.</p>
