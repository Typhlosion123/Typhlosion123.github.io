                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I am not always doing something productive, here are some hobbies I enjoy. </p>
              </header>
              <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/HOBBIES.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
              <p>In the midst of life's daily hustle, my hobbies have become my sanctuary, bringing immense enjoyment
                and fulfillment. Immersing myself in the virtual battlegrounds of Valorant allows me to unwind and
                challenge myself in a virtual realm of strategy and skill. The thrill of intense matches and the
                camaraderie with fellow gamers make every gaming session an unforgettable adventure. Similarly, hitting
                the gym has become my refuge, where I can push my physical limits, channeling stress into strength, and
                feeling rejuvenated after each workout. Alongside my physical pursuits, I find joy in the realm of
                learning, delving into new topics, from fascinating historical events to cutting-edge scientific
                discoveries. It's a journey of constant growth and enrichment that fuels my curiosity and passion for
                knowledge. And, amidst it all, the universal language of music serves as my emotional anchor, providing
                solace during quiet moments and invigorating energy during my endeavors. Each of these hobbies brings a
                unique sense of enjoyment, allowing me to escape, evolve, and embrace the beauty of life in its various
                forms.</p>
